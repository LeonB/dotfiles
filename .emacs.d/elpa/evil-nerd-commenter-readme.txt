This program emulates nerd-commenter.vim by Marty Grenfell.
It help you comment/uncomment multiple lines without selecting them.

`M-x evilnc-default-hotkeys` assigns hotkey `M-;` to `evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines`
`M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines` comment or uncomment lines.
`M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line` will comment/uncomment from current line to
the specified line number. The line number is passed as parameter of the command.
For example, `C-u 99 evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line` will comment code from
current line to line 99.

Though this program could be used *independently*, I highly recommend you use it with
evil (http://gitorious.org/evil)

Evil makes you take advantage of power of Vi to comment lines in shocking speed.
For example, you can press key `99,ci` to comment out 99 lines.
