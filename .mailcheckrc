# mailcheckrc	Default configuration for Mailcheck program
#
# This is a sample mailcheckrc file.  It provies a good starting point,
# but it probably isn't exactly what you want.  See mailcheck(1) for
# more information.

# If you edit /etc/login.defs to turn off mailbox checking, you'll
# probably want to enable this next line:
#/var/spool/mail/$(USER)

# If you're using qmail's Maildir feature, you'll probably want to
# enable this line:
$(HOME)/Maildir/

# For qmail's mbox file in user's home directory:
#$(HOME)/Mailbox

# Mailcheck also supports remote POP3 and IMAP mailboxes.  Most users
# will want to set these up in a .mailcheckrc file in their home
# directory, not here.

# If you have a remote POP3 mailbox, use a line like the following
# if your username is the same there as here.
#pop3://servername
#
# If your POP3 username is different there than here:
#pop3://username@servernameint
#
# In either case, you need to put an entry in $HOME/.netrc for the password.
# .netrc is in the form:
#
#   machine mail.example.com login rmf1 password MyPasWrd
#
# where mail.example.com, rmf1, and MyPasWrd are the values for your account,
# and machine, login, and password are literal text in the file.

# An IMAP account is similar to a POP account, but you can specify a
# mailbox path:
#imap://servername/inbox

# For both POP3 and IMAP, you can specify a nonstandard port:
#pop3://servername:1110
#imap://servername:1143/inbox
